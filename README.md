Challenge Prompt: Create a simple application using React and the Blockchain API that loads and displays the balance and transactions for a bitcoin address someone searches, and updates on incoming transactions.

Please send me the Github link when you've finished.

Please let me know if you want to do the challenge or send your crypto project over.

As mentioned, if you do the project, please send it to me by next Tuesday that would be ideal.
